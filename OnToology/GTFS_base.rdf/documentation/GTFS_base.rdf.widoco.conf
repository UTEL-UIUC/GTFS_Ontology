abstract=The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) ontology is a comprehensive framework designed to standardize and represent public transit information in a machine-readable format, facilitating the sharing, analysis, and utilization of transit data across different platforms and applications. This ontology extends the GTFS, a widely adopted format for specifying public transit schedules, routes, and associated geographic information, by providing a semantic model that captures the relationships and constraints inherent in transit data.

At its core, the GTFS ontology defines a set of classes and properties corresponding to the various components of transit data, such as agencies, stops, routes, trips, and schedules. Each class represents a specific aspect of transit information, with properties detailing the attributes and relationships between these aspects. For instance, the ontology includes classes for transit agencies, with properties describing agency details, and for transit routes, with properties defining route characteristics and linking routes to their serving agencies and stops.

The ontology leverages RDF (Resource Description Framework) to define these classes and properties, employing URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to uniquely identify each element. RDFS (RDF Schema) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) are used to express hierarchies, constraints, and logical relationships, enabling sophisticated querying and reasoning over transit data. This semantic richness allows for the detailed representation of transit operations, supporting advanced use cases such as multimodal journey planning, accessibility analysis, and dynamic schedule adjustments.
